# Basics of Go

- Go is a statically typed, compiled language.
- It is a general-purpose language designed with systems programming in mind.
- It was developed by Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.
- Go is a statically typed language, which means that variables always have a specific type and that type cannot change. However, Go supports type conversion, which allows you to convert a value from one type to another.
- Go is also a compiled language, meaning that you need to compile your Go code to create an executable file that can be run on your computer.
