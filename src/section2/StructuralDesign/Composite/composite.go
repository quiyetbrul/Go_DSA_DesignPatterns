package composite

/*
The Composite pattern is a structural design pattern that
allows to compose objects into tree structures to
represent part-whole hierarchies.
This pattern lets clients treat individual objects
and compositions of objects uniformly.

- helps to shape applications with commonly used structures and relationships
  - composition "has-a" relationship, inheritance "is-a" relationship
- golang encourages use of composition almost exclusively by its lack of inheritance
